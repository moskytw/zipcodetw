The ZIP Code Finder for Taiwan
==============================

This package lets you find ZIP code by address in Taiwan.

The main features:

1. Fast. It builds ZIP code index by tokenization.
2. Gradual. It returns partial ZIP code rather than noting when address is not
   detailed enoguh.
3. Stand-alone. It depends on nothing.

Usage
-----

Find ZIP code gradually:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import zipcodetw
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市')
    u'1'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市信義區')
    u'110'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市信義區市府路')
    u'110'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市信義區市府路1號')
    u'11008'

After v0.3, you even can find ZIP code like:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> zipcodetw.find('松山區')
    u'105'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('秀山街')
    u''
    >>> zipcodetw.find('台北市秀山街')
    u'10042'

Translate address to english gradually:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import zipcodetw
    >>> zipcodetw.translate('臺北市')
    u'Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)'
    >>> zipcodetw.translate('臺北市信義區')
    u'Xinyi Dist., Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)'
    >>> zipcodetw.translate('臺北市信義區市府路')
    u'Shifu Rd., Xinyi Dist., Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)'
    >>> zipcodetw.translate('臺北市信義區市府路1號')
    u'No. 1, Shifu Rd., Xinyi Dist., Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)'

Installation
------------

It is available on PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install zipcodetw

Just install it and have fun. :)

Build Index Manually
--------------------

If you install it by ``pip`` or ``python setup.py install``, a ZIP code index
will be built automatically. But if you want to use it from source code, you
have to build an index manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m zipcodetw.builder

Data
----

The ZIP code directory is provided by Chunghwa Post, and is available
from: http://www.post.gov.tw/post/internet/down/index.html#1808
